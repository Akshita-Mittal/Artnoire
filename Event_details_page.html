              One of the best moments as a creator is to see something that's lived inside your head, something you've dreamed about - actually come to fruition. <span class="p-color">Art Noire</span> is here but this is only the genesis. The platform will continue to evolve into something much greater.
              </p>
              <div class="content__bx content-event">
                <p>
                  For now, I want to introduce you to what Art Noire is in its present state. The website is separated into 3 parts: Media, Business Tools, and Community. All play an integral part into the overall vision of Art Noire.
                </p>
                <p>
                  First let's start with media. I remember the first article ever written about me. It wasn't a big platform or anything but it was something I could call my own which told my story. I want to be a platform where artists can get spotlighted for the first time and be given a platform to be discovered. Not only will there be content on the website but our fastly growing community on Instagram.

                </p>                   
              </div>
        </div>
        <div class="img">
          <div class="img__Bx">
            <figure class="MEdia__IMG"><img src="assets/images/event-detail-image1.jpg"></figure>
          </div>
          <div class="img__Bx">
            <figure class="MEdia__IMG"><img src="assets/images/event-detail-image2.jpg"></figure>
          </div>
        </div>
         <div class="content__bx content-event">
          <p>
            One of my inspirations for Art Noire was Product Hunt, a community created by a personal friend Ryan Hoover. The community submits new products/companies and its
            a way for people to discover new products and services. The beauty behind the community is that not only does it give exposure and free marketing to the ntrepreneurs who built the company but it also attracts investors. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I want Art Noire to work similarly in a sense. Instead of investors, I want collectors and gallerists to use the platform to discover new talent as well as give casual art fans a way 
            to discover artists they may like and want to purchase from. Getting into the world of art can be challenging, it's a complex community. One in which I'm still learning about. I'll be the first to admit that I'm still very much a novice compared to many. But I wanted to create a comfortable space for people to start to educate themselves about art 
            and not feel intimidated. The second portion is called Business Tools. This section is broken into two parts. The first being “Free Business Tools.” The reason for creating this was a way to help artists/creatives on the business side. Many artists I've spoken to, while excelling as a creative - struggle when it comes to organization and the business side of things.
          </p>
          <h3 class="media_heading_c event-heading">We launched with three free tools: an Invoice Generator, <br> Meeting Scheduler, & Business Directory.</h3>
          <p>
            The Invoice Generator will allow artists to create custom invoices that they can send to their clients. The Meeting Scheduler will allow artists to send a link to potential clients or interested parties to set up meetings and showings of their work. Lastly the Business Directory will have a list of lawyers, financial advisors, and accountants that creatives can reach out to for help.
          </p>
          <p>
            The last part is Community which I'm most excited for. The community side will consist of scholarships, events, and even a merch shop.
          </p>
          <p>
            The inspiration behind the Art Noire Scholarship program is the many artists I've come across struggling to make ends meet or even having enough money to buy the simple things like paint, canvas and other materials they need to create their work. The scholarship will help fund those artists in dire situations and allow their creativity to come to life and a chance to build something for themselves.
          </p>
          <p>
            The merch shop is pretty self explanatory but we will have official Art Noire gear for purchase as well as give away a ton of free merch as well. In the future we plan to do collaborations with different artists for unique merch to be sold in our shop to help artists generate more income. Lastly events will be one of the cornerstones of Art Noire. Starting soon Art Noire will be hosting events in individual cities celebrating and spotlighting the dopest artists from those cities. It will be rooms 
            open to any and everybody, a place where even the most casual of art fans can feel comfortable and enjoy themselves. I want to bring the community together to celebrate something positive. 
          </p>
          <h3 class="media_heading_c event-heading">For now, this is Art Noire but the vision is so much greater. Can't wait for you to see what's next.</h3>
